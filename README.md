### Elevator Pitch
You know that feeling when you want to change your haircut but only have a picture of half of a guy's head to show the barber and have to hope the cut actually looks good on you? The Lezicuts application not only lets you keep track of your hair length, but also lets you browse haircuts with detailed specifications submitted by professional stylists and users alike so you can tell your barber exactly what you want!
